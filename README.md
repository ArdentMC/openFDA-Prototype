## The Team
* Scrum Master and Leader: Amy Rosen
* Technical Architect: Jim Correll
* Front End Developer: Gene Staten
* Back End Developer: Justin Downs
* DevOps Engineer: Elise Walker
* Our Users: Everyone we could lay hands on

## Our Approach
The approach we took in developing this prototype - any piece software, really - follows a few simple rules:
* Incorporate user feedback as soon as possible, ideally before anything is written
* Get a working product in the hands of our users as soon as possible
* Based on user feedback and gathered metrics, continuously iterate upon the design in small batch sizes

To that end, our development cycle began with the team studying the openFDA API to learn what sort of data was available and brainstorm on a few possible product ideas. Once we had a short list, we approached a handful of prospective users and began running our ideas passed them.  Lo and behold, all of them were met with varying degrees of disdain and indifference.  But, one idea that came from one of ours struck a chord with us.  We went back to the drawing board, tweaked the idea some and brought it back to the same users and suddenly, they were excited about the possibilities.  We didn't come up with the idea for our application, our prospective users did.
