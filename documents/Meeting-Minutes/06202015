Meeting minutes from 6/20/2015
Does the hosting provider have to be free and open source? Is this the final question? Following up with you on this Jim. The deadline to submit it 6/22/2015.


Still continuing to work on the current user stories and add notes to them .

For now Elise will be taking everyone’s code and merge and build together but this will become extremely un efficient and we will need better resources for the developers to do this themselves. Elise is also restructuring the code as it comes in. Jim will check in  with Josh to see what can be done to bump up vm/ resources for the developers and let us know.

Gene will be installing linux and looking into mongo db.
Jim is looking into why Elise cannot access Azure.

Justin continue to research. Justin has worked on the registration portion for the base application and Gene has worked on API calls.
Gene will send the group a screenshot of what the list looks like that gets returned for the calls to drug and food.

If I have missed anything feel free to add.  We’ll meet again tomorrow at the same time.

Thanks,

Amy
